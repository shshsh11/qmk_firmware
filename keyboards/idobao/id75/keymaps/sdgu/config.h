// 100 is too low of a tapping term, requires too much of a tap, can't really roll
// 150 seems to not have very noticeable delay but is also pretty consistent when wanting to type space
// 200 is somewhat stuttery but also I kind of need to pay attention and type consistently to notice it

// notes: combo for shift, mod tap everything else
// to test: rolling keypressed
// - all three settings off: does not behave how I want (mod is favored)
// - only HOLD_ON_OTHER_KEY_PRESS on: does not behave how I want (mod is favored)
// - only PERMISSIVE_HOLD on: does not behave how I want (mod is favored)
// - only IGNORE_MOD_TAP_INTERRUPT on: does not behave how I want (bigram is favored, but combo+mod-tap does not lead to capital)
// - IGNORE_MOD_TAP_INTERRUPT and PERMISSIVE_HOLD on: does not behave how I want (current most preferred, bigram is favored, but combo+mod-tap does not lead to capital)
// - IGNORE_MOD_TAP_INTERRUPT and HOLD_ON_OTHER_KEY_PRESS on: does not behave how I want (mod is favored)
// - PERMISSIVE_HOLD and HOLD_ON_OTHER_KEY_PRESS on: does not behave how I want (mod is favored)
